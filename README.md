The reuse of a pre-trained model on a new problem is known as transfer learning in machine learning. A machine uses the knowledge learned from a prior assignment to increase prediction about a new task in transfer learning. You could, for example, use the information gained during training to distinguish beverages when training a classifier to predict whether an image contains cuisine.

The reuse of a previously learned model on a new problem is known as transfer learning. Itâ€™s particularly popular in deep learning right now since it can train deep neural networks with a small amount of data. This is particularly valuable in the field of data science, as most real-world situations do not require millions of labelled data points to train complicated models.

Transfer learning offers a number of advantages, the most important of which are reduced training time, improved neural network performance (in most circumstances), and the absence of a large amount of data.
